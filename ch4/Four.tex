\chapter{Conceptual Clusterings, Similarity, and Relatedness} \label{chap:literal}
In Chapter~\ref{chap:theory}, I laid out the theoretical groundwork for statistical context sensitive models of lexical semantics, and in Chapter~\ref{chap:method} I described the actual methodology for building such much.  In this chapter, I will now present the first set of experiments designed to evaluate the utility of this methodology.  These experiments are intended to probe the productivity of a context sensitive, geometric approach to building a computational model of semantics based on statistics about word co-occurrences.  They encompass two different experimental set-ups and corresponding varieties of data, one of which has been designed specifically for the purpose of testing my ideas and one of which involves an assortment of data used pervasively by computational linguistics interested in semantic models.

The first experiment, presented as a proof of concept, involves using multi-word phrases as input and evaluating the methodology's capacity for building subspaces where words associated with the conceptual category denoted by the input term can be reliably discovered.  This experiment expands upon the notion of proto-conceptual spaces outlined in the previous chapter, considering whether the word vectors that populate regions of subspaces are characterised by a certain categorical coherence.  In the case of the data explored here, the experiment is specifically set up to feel out the contextual capacity of my methodology and compare it to a standard generic semantic space.  The question asked is whether the shifts from subspace to subspace based on particular input yield productive alterations in the way that words both cluster and emerge from the melange of word-vectors that circulate around my base model.

The second experiment moves into more familiar computational linguistic territory, using some well-travelled datasets to examine the methodology's capacity for identifying two related but distinct semantic phenomena: relatedness and similarity.  Each of these objectives have provided reliable but distinct evaluative criteria for computational models of lexical semantics.  One of the hypotheses I will put forward regarding my methodology is that the geometrically replete subspaces generated by my contextualisation techniques should provide features for the simultaneous representation of related, diverse, and sometimes antagonistic aspects of language.  Experimenting with these established datasets will provide a platform for exploring the ways in which different features of a semantic structure projected into one of my contextualised subspaces shift as the relationships inherent in the generation of the subspace likewise change, and this will in turn lead to some searching questions about the importance of context in the computational modelling of these particular semantic phenomena in the first place.

\section{A Proof of Concept}
In this section, I present the first experiment performed using my contextually dynamic distributional semantic model.  The gist of this experiment is to take a word pair representing a compound noun -- for instance, \emph{body part} -- and see if my methodology can use the word pair to contextually generate a space where other words conceptually related to that compound noun can be found in a systematic way.  This is conceived of as an entailment task, in that I will attempt to find phrases considered to be categorical constituents of the concept represented by the word pair, taking the WordNet lexical taxonomy as a ground truth.  There is a scholastic back story here.

An early version of this experiment was reported in \cite{AgresEA2015}.  That first effort arose out of a question posed by a colleague regarding the feasibility of using a statical NLP technique for generating categorical labels that could be used to evaluate computational creativity in a domain specific way \citep[for a psychological perspective on the difficulty of generating such terms in an objective way using human subjects, see][]{VanDerVeldeEA2015}.  So, for instance, given a creative domain such as \textsc{musical creativity}, could a distributional semantic model generate terms that are reliably relevant to the concept denoted by that phrase, rather than the potentially disparate properties independently associated with \textsc{music} and \textsc{creativity}?  Intuitively there seems to be little reason to hope that the space halfway between these points in a general semantic space would somehow adequately represent the properties of the overall concept.  The early work explored the dimensions contextually selected by analysing the co-occurrence features of word-vectors corresponding to inputs along the lines of the expository results presented anecdotally in Chapter~\ref{chap:method}, but without any rigorous evaluation.

Reviewer responses to a subsequent journal article \citep{McGregorEA2015c}, designed as a more thorough introduction of the methodology, inspired a computationally oriented mode of evaluation.  The experiment that has emerged involves attempting to recapitulate taxonomical conceptual relationships from the WordNet database \citep{Fellbaum1998}.  Wordnet is a lexical taxonomy of \emph{synsets}, basically semantic word senses, arranged into a hierarchy of entailment relationships, with each synset associate with a number of \emph{lemmas}, word types indexed by that synset according to human annotators.  This experiment takes as input instances of synsets labelled by compound noun phrases and seeks to output as many of the lemmas listed associated with synsets that are hyponyms of the input synset.  So, for instance, the synset \text{body part} has a hyponym \textsc{external body part}, which has a hyponym \textsc{extremity}, which has a synset \textsc{limb}, which has a synset \textsc{leg} associated with the lemma \emph{leg}, and so \emph{leg} would be considered a positive output for the input \emph{body part}.\footnote{In keeping with the convention used elsewhere in this thesis, synset labels will be presented in small caps and lemmas will be presented in italics.}

\subsection{Experimental Set-Up}
12 of the top synset labels consisting of compound noun phrases are extracted from WordNet.  These labels are extracted through a breadth first traversal of the tree of noun synsets, selecting the highest 12 synsets with multi-word labels with the constraint that none of the 12 can be parent nodes of any of the others: in this way, 12 distinct, non-overlapping conceptual categories are choosen.  The experimental vocabulary is considered to be the intersection of the list of all WordNet noun lemmas associated with the vocabulary of my model (the 200,000 most frequent word types in Wikipedia), resulting in a total vocabulary of 32,155 words.  The lemmas associated with all the hyponyms of each synset are extracted and grouped, and these words become the target words for my models' output.

With the target output established, the terms labelling a given synset are passed to my model as contextual input, with the corresponding word-vectors serving as the basis for dimensional selection using the \textsc{joint}, \textsc{indy}, and \textsc{zipped} techniques as outlined in Chapter~\ref{chap:method}.  Here, the base space generated using a 5x5 word co-occurrence window is used, and 200 dimensional subspaces are returned; variations of these parameters will be tested in subsequent experiments.  The subspaces returned by each of these techniques are explored to return the top terms using both of the procedures outlined in Chapter~\ref{sec:twomeasures}: the terms closes to the mean point between the input word-vectors in a subspace are returned, and the terms furthest from the origin -- the terms with the largest norm -- in a given subspace are returned.  The top 50 terms found in a subspace each according to each measure are returned, as well as the top terms up to a limit $n$ where $n$ is the total number of lemmas associated with the target multi-word label.  Accuracy scores for each of these sets of output are computed, so the total number of positive matches for hyponyms of the input synset out of the top 50 and top $n$ terms returned.

As a point of comparison, results are likewise returned from two different \texttt{word2vec} models, one using the skip-gram methodology and one using the bag-of-words methodology, as described in Chapter~\ref{sec:w2v}.  In line with the subspaces generated using my methodology, 200 dimensional models are used, and these models are built across 10 iterations of the corpus, using a 5x5 word co-occurrence window, applying a negative sampling rate of 10 and an initial learning rate of 0.025, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:w2v}.  Here the top terms in terms of proximity by cosine similarity to the mean point between the word-vectors associated with the input terms are returned, again taking the top 50 and top $n$ for each input.

\subsection{Results and Analysis}
Results for the set-up described in the previous section can be found in Table~\ref{tab:wordnet}, with both the average accuracy scores and the average ratio of model accuracy to baseline reported.  Results for both the norm and distance from mean point methods are reported for subspaces derived using the \textsc{joint}, \textsc{indy}, and \textsc{zipped} dimension selection techniques, followed by results for the skip-gram and bag-of-words \texttt{word2vec} techniques.  The first thing to note about these results is that all of the results are substantially above the baseline: the average ratios of model accuracy to the baseline (the likely accuracy achieved by randomly choosing words from the vocabulary for each input) are all above 2.5, and are above 3.2 for all of my methodologies.  So it is clear that all these techniques are generating semantically significant relationships between word-vectors.

\end{table}

Results across the board are strongest for the \textsc{joint} dimension selection technique applying the norm measure for returning output: in these subspaces selected by choosing dimensions with high PMI values across all contextual inputs, word-vectors that are far from the orgins -- and that therefore likewise tend to have high values across all these dimensions -- are most characteristic of the conceptual category indicated by the input.  This is not surprising.  Results for the norm measure applied to \textsc{zipped} and \textsc{indy} type subspaces follow in kind, with intermediary performance from the in-between \textsc{zipped} technique, where all dimensions bear at least some tendency for co-occurrence with the input terms, and then another step down for the \textsc{indy} subspaces.  In all cases the norm measure outperforms the two \texttt{word2vec} results.

More surprising is the distinction between the strong performance of the norm measures and the less impressive performance of the mean point measure.  In the case of accuracy among the top 50 terms returned by each model, my methodologies results using this Euclidean measure consistently fall short of the \texttt{word2vec} techniques.  It would seem, then, that in the subspaces returned by my models, proximity to the input word-vectors is not in itself an indicator of categorical inclusion in the conceptual space traced by the intersection of the correspond contextual input terms.  Upon further consideration, there is a plausible explanation for this: revisiting the outputs for subspaces projected using denotations of animals as input, reported last chapter in Tables~\ref{tab:wild} and~\ref{tab:pet}, the norm measure produced specialised terms such as \emph{chital} and \emph{poodle}, while the distance measure generated relevant but not always categorical terms such as \emph{wild}, \emph{giant}, and \emph{golden}.

We might characterise this tend in terms of a distinction between words which denote semantic \emph{relatedness} versus \emph{similarity}, a topic which will be addressed in depth in the next section.

SOME EXAMPLES

Focusing on the accuracy of the results returned by the models up to the full length of each target set of lemmas, here results are weaker all around, which is not particularly surprising: as we move away from the regions where we expected to see the highest degree of conceptual consistency, mismatched terms begin to creep into the results.  It is notable, though, that my methodologies outperform the neural network based models across the board, especially for the norm based measures but also in the case of this larger sample of the respective semantic spaces for the distance based measures.  In fact, the stronger relative performance for the distance measure in these expanded regions of each type of subspace makes sense, since, as the norms measure moves closer to the origin in search of output and the distance measure likewise expands from the locus of its mean point, the results output by each measure will increasingly overlap (an overlaying of Figures~\ref{fig:geo1-dist} and~\ref{geo1-norm} will illustrate this phenomenon).  But the main point to take here is that, in the case of my methodologies, there is clearly a more persistent conceptual organisation to the space.  As we expand from any point in the static type of semantic model generated by \texttt{word2vec}, we will undoubtedly begin to encounter the vagary and the messiness inherent in language and problematic for fixed lexical relationships.  My methodologies, on the other hand, afford the \emph{ad hoc} construction of semantic spaces which afford the situational corralling of the looseness and ambiguity inherent in a dynamic lexicon.
