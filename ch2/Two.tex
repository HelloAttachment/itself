\chapter{Background}
The ambitious scope of this project requires a thorough grounding in the literature from a range of disciplines.  The risk in such an inclusive undertaking is that there are many opportunities for going astray.  The reward, a piece of empirical work that exemplifies the possibility of using computers to do theoretically significant research, seems to justify the risk, but only if the final product is well placed in the context of existing work in the area.  The following chapter will delineate the territory that this thesis seeks to explore, by way of a survey of the considerable canon of theoretical work relating to the problems of minds, concepts, and language as well as the increasingly substantial body of practical work on computational linguistics and its application to the modelling of creative language generation.

\section{Computers, Creativity, and Making Meaning}
At its heart, this is a project about how meaning comes about in a reality which, as scientists, we accept as being fundamentally materialist.  The question of the place of the mind -- the instrument of meaning making -- in relation to the realm of matter has been arguably the unifying theme of modern Western Philosophy, dating back to the \emph{cogito} of \cite{Descartes} and serving as the broad target of subsequent forays into 

The recent trend in philosophy, not to mention in empirically fastidious fields such as cognitive science and psychology, has been towards a resolute reductionism, to such an extent that \cite{Rowlands} reports that in the current cognitive scientific milieu, ``even the word `Cartesian' is often used as a term of abuse,'' (p. 12).  Those thinkers who do indulge in dualist theories of mind -- and here \cite{Chalmers1996} and \cite{Fodor2008} are two of the most notable examples -- do so through 

\footnote{Chalmers's ``philosophical zombies'' argument has proven particularly retrenchent here, though parallels between this and the earlier ``swampman'' scenario from \cite{Davidson} and the self-manifesting lion of \cite{Milikan} have been arguably underexplored in the literature.  The fact that thought experiments have proved so prodigious a source of ideas about the mind is in itself noteworthy, and is addressed in a certain respect in \citepos{Dennett} case against ``intuition pumps''.}

The debate that has emerged amongst those researchers interested in the nature of the mind in the place of the old question of 

is focused on the extent to which the mind can be considered a kind of computer versus the degree to which the mind can only be understood as an emergent property of an agent deeply entangled with a dynamic and unpredictable environment.

At stake here is, in at least small part, a definition of \emph{creativity} itself, and \cite{Colton} has pointed out that this term must be considered ``essentially contested,''

\section{Minds in a Material World}


At its heart, this is a project about the potential for symbol manipulating machines to model creativity, and in particular the creative use of language.  Computational Creativity is a field that, as \cite{Wiggins2006b} puts it, uses ``computational means and methods'' to study ``behaviour exhibited by natural and artificial systems, which would be deemed creative if exhibited by humans,'' (p. 210).  At stake here is the problem of what creativity actually is, and, as \cite{Colton} have said, the concept of creativity must be \emph{essentially contested}.  Nonetheless, a basic position will be taken here that at the root of creativity is, in the spirit of \cite{Wittgenstein1953}, an act of meaning-making, by which a new way of conceptually representing something in the world comes about.

The prevalent take on computational creativity has focused on an AI approach involving the traversal of state spaces for potential creative artefacts, a methodology with deep roots in \cite{Boden1990}.  Philosophical problems with this essentially symbolic mode of generation have been illustrated by \cite{McGregorEA2014}, though: the dependency on preconditioned representations remits little in the way of actual creative behaviour on the part of the symbol manipulating agent.  Here the hard question of evaluation comes up, and the evaluative challenges peculiar to computational creativity have been addressed by \cite{Ritchie2007}, \cite{ColtonEA2012B}, and \cite{Jordanous2012}, to name a few.  At the core of this project is the proposal that, for an agent to be perceived as genuinely and autonomously instigating meaning-making, there has to be at least a nominal notion of the trafficking of dynamic, interactive representations within the agent's cognitive framework.  It is here that computational creativity will serve as a compass to keep this project on course: by returning to the question of whether the model outlined here can be described as an agent that is behaving creatively, the pragmatic issue of the role of contextualisation in the actual use of language will stay central to the thesis.

In addition to a general survey of the field, this project's particular commitment to conceptualisation and metaphor invites a survey of the appreciable work done in the computational production of metaphor and analogy.  With roots in the conceptual blending theory of \cite{Turner}, this area has been explored more recently by the likes of \cite{VealeEA2007} and \cite{O'Donoghue}.  Additional attention is due to work in poetry generation coming from \cite{Gervas}, \cite{Toivonen}, \cite{Rashel}, \cite{Cardosa}, and others.

\section{Minds and Spaces}
\cite{Davidson} cautions against considering language as an ``organising system'' (p. 11) for conceptual schemes.  In the process of understanding a sentence, a contextually specific theory of meaning is devised on the spot, so to speak, that permits ``an acceptable theory of belief'' (p. 18) regarding the sentence's author.  This means, though, that the conceptual organisation supposedly inherent in language is in fact a fleeting artefact that temporarily props up a momentary propositional stance, and language is just a mechanism for groping towards some sort of understanding between communicants regarding positions on the relationship between meaning and belief.  A consequence of this theoretical insight is the temptation to resort to a view such as that taken by \cite{Clark}, who holds that language is ``a cognition-enhancing animal-built structure,'' (p. 370).

The theoretical premise of this project is that a structural, spatial, geometric language model can successfully capture significant aspects of conceptualisation.  In this regard, the work is grounded in the theories of \cite{Gardenfors} and \cite{Widdows}.  G\"{a}rdenfors in particular postulates a kind of cognitive middle ground where conceptual spaces, characterised by coherent dimensions which map to features of concepts, stand between low level stimuli and high level symbolic representations.  Widdows, on the other hand, is more concerned with the description of a language model where a geometry of words facilitates the mechanisms of logic.  In both cases, these authors provide insight into the way that a specifically geometric view of representations allows for the dynamic interaction of symbols by way of using language as a cognitively productive system.

This project's commitment to building a system which remits evidence of dynamic representational structures is admittedly reminiscent of \cite{Fodor}, who holds that concepts are fundamentally compositional mental entities.  Any nativist forebodings engendered here are diffused somewhat by \citepos{Putnam} insight that conceptual extension cannot strictly be found ``in the head'' (p. 170).  In this regard, work in embodied cognitive science, rooted in the enactivism of \cite{Varela}, provides the cognitive foundation for a spatially charged theory of concepts.  So \cite{Thompson} goes on to offer a definition of information as ``the intentional relation of the system to its milieu,'' (p. 59), a view which attempts to capture the tight relationship between the spatial situation of the world and the symbolic representation of that situation \citep[][is another notable proponent of this approach]{Pattee}.  Similarly, the Heideggarian account of \cite{Wheeler}, with reference to \cite{Clark}, postulates an \emph{action-oriented representation} where the very structural nature of representations are ``deeply dependent on the specific context of action,'' (p. 196).  In the end the theory of language embraced here will be characterised by \citepos{Gibson} notion of \emph{affordances}: just as with physical objects, words present themselves as opportunities for communication, and it is in the ready-to-hand appropriation of meaning that the genesis of metaphor is to be discovered.

\section{Words and Concepts}
In the spirit of \cite{Peirce}, this thesis is predicated on the idea that the signs constituting a language are involved in a physically grounded process that is perpetually unfolding in tight entanglement with the world.  As mentioned in the previous section, this stance leads on to the view that the compositional components of a language offer themselves as affordances for communication in the context of a particular environmental situation.  It is by virtue of this opportunistic seizing of linguistic units as operational elements in a system of contextualised conceptual representation that language becomes so readily figurative.  And it is here the work connects with the theories of metaphor produced by \cite{Black} and \cite{Lakoff}, who see figurative language as interactions between isomorphic conceptual structures of one sort or another.

The account of metaphor as a simple process of intensional projection, such as that offered by \cite{Searle}, is confounded by \cite{Davidson}, who makes a controversial but ultimately persuasive case for the idea that so-called figurative language must in fact be interpreted literally because the pragmatically meaningful component of metaphor transpires on a level which is non-sentential.  \cite{Carston} fleshes out this claim, drawing on the inherently \emph{imagistic} quality of metaphor to offer an account of how the conceptual economy inherent in figurative expression involves components that cannot possibly be captured propositionally.  Similarly, \cite{Reimer} draws out a distinction between the \emph{meaning} and the \emph{intimation} of a metaphor, concluding that it is this second, no-propositional quality that gives figurative language its distinct character.

At stake here is a basic notion about the contextual nature of conceptualisation, something that \cite{Barsalou} has described in terms of the \emph{haphazard} way in which concepts are formed in response to a situation in an environment.  In the same vein, it is again \cite{Carston} who, from a relevance theoretical perspective, has characterised the formulation of concepts as \emph{ad hoc}, in particular analysing the way in which meaning is appropriated for some pragmatic purpose in the course of metaphor making.  In response to Carston, \cite{Allott} have made the case that \emph{ad hoc} concepts cannot possibly be \emph{atomic}, preferring instead to view concept formation as a process of inference involving some sort of clustering of information on a contextual basis.

This last theory of conceptualisation as a process of informational clustering begins to look a lot like the computational model that will be described in this thesis.  By pushing these clusters into an explicitly geometric representation, the hope is that a kind of non-propositional structure will emerge, satisfying apt points regarding the nature of metaphor raised by Davidson and his acolytes and, at the same time, providing a concrete basis for the sort of conceptually anatomic mapping proposed by Lakoff and Johnson.  Viewed in this light, computational linguistics, with its propensity for the construction of informational structures in a high-dimensional space, becomes the natural domain for a dynamically unfolding, context sensitive model of figurative language.

\section{Computers and Language}
At last, from a practical perspective, this work must be placed in relation to the ongoing work in computational linguistics, and in particular on the type of high dimensional, corpus based, generally unsupervised language modelling that will be at the core of the project presented here.  The idea that statistical word representations can be constructed in such a way as to be dynamically interactive is inherent in the work on compositionality done by, for instance, \cite{CoeckeEA2011} and \cite{GreffenstetteEA2011} \citep[see][for an overview]{MitchellEA2010}.  While the model described in this thesis does not target compositionality, the idea that linguistic representations can only capture conceptualisation by being somehow dynamically interactive is implicit in distributional semantic approaches to compositionality.

In terms of vector space models of distributional semantics in general, \cite{Clark2015} offers a good contemporary overview of work in the field.  The model described here, populated as it is by literal co-occurrence statistics rather than abstract values learned through iterations over a weighted network, distinguishes itself from the ongoing trend towards models with abstract dimensions, which can trace its roots back to the matrix factorisation based techniques developed by, for instance, \cite{DeerwesterEA1990} and \cite{BleiEA2003}.  More recently, the neural network based approaches of, for instance, \cite{BengioEA2003}, \cite{CollobertEA2008}, and \cite{MikolovEA2013} have achieved impressive results.  Mikolov et al in particular, along with \cite{PenningtonEA2014}, who present a model involving a hybrid of weighted networks and matrix factorisation, have achieved state-of-theart results on analogy completion tasks.  In the case of these models, however, the opacity of the scalars which constitute the word-spaces means there can be no hope of capturing the contextually informed theory of conceptualisation surveyed in the previous section.  Instead, to the degree that context is captured at all, it is found in the multiplicity of directions of movement offered by the dimensionality of the one irreducible space.  Ultimately, it seems that the analogy test sets which these systems target really just embodied a very specific type of figurative language, and subsequent systems have, by focusing on this particular objective, built this specificity into their own procedures.

Beyond analogy, ongoing work in taxonomy completion and, more generally, the inferential capacities of statistical language models is germane to the project described in this thesis.  To this end, work from \cite{CimianoEA2003} and \cite{SnowEA2006} provides a good exemplar of current directions in the field.  More recently, \cite{SantusEA2014} have presented an energy based model for determining hypernymy based on lexical statistics, while \cite{LevyEA2015} have offered a rebuttal to some of the ongoing work in the area, suggesting that a range of supervised learning language models actually do not recognise conceptual relationships between words, but rather simply model the probability of a term being used to describe a categorical \emph{prototype}.  In related work, \cite{SocherEA2013} have proposed a neural tensor model for completing knowledge bases, again with impressive results.

Ultimately there is a certain correlation between the project described in this thesis and the comprehensive objective of research from \cite{BaroniEA2010b}, who describe a generalised statistical language model designed to perform well on a wide array of language processing tasks.  Elsewhere, \citepos{BaroniEA2010} work on composing adjective-noun pairs into singular vector representations is also relevant, as the adjective, represented on its own as a matrix, might be taken as a contextualising mechanism.
