\chapter{A Computational Implementation of Context Sensitive Distributional Semantics}
In the previous chapter, I laid the theoretical groundwork for a distributional semantic methodology for dynamically establishing perspectives on statistical data about language use.  In this chapter, I'll describe the technical details for building a computational implementation of such a methodology.
