\chapter{Conclusion}

Word frequency is not a thing that is directly perceived: though I could make an informed guess, I do not actually have a sense of how often I've encountered the word \emph{the} recently, versus the word \emph{volcano}, versus the word \emph{gulgirate}.  Meaning, on the other hand, if we take XXX seriously, is directly perceived.

``the familiar physiogomy of a word, the feeling that it has taken up its meaning into itself,'' \citep[][p. 218]{Wittgenstein}
