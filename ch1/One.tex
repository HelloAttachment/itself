\chapter{Introduction}
``Words,'' writes Thomas Pynchon in \emph{Gravity's Rainbow}, ``are only an eye-twitch away from the things they stand for.''

\section{A Question and A Hypothesis}
In my research I have sought to explore the question of the extent to which the type of data-driven, statistical mechanisms available to a symbol manipulating, information processing machine can 

\section{Contributions to the Field}
First and foremost, this thesis presents a novel computational methodology for using linguistic data to generate conceptually productive geometries of word-vectors.

The second contribution of the work described here is to apply a noteworthy but under-represented current of theoretical work in linguistics and the philosophy of language to computational approaches to words and concepts.

\section{Methods}
In the case of comparisons between correlations, the method for establishing the probability of results not invalidating the null hypothesis -- which is to say, the chances of the results happening by pure chance given the hypothetical viccitudes of the data -- will be calculated using the Fisher r-to-z transform.  This equation takes as input a correlation coefficient between model output and target data
